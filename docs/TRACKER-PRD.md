# ForgeAI Manual Workout Tracker — PRD & Phased Build Plan

**Status:** DRAFT for approval (2026-07-08). No feature code until the owner approves.
**Companion docs:** research → `docs/HEVY-RESEARCH.md`; frozen APIs → `docs/CONTRACTS.md`;
pivot record → `docs/PLAN.md → PRODUCT PIVOT`; live status → `PROGRESS.md`.

---

## 1. Goal & non-goals

**Goal.** Make ForgeAI's **manual workout logging + its analytics** best-in-class — *simple, clean,
fast, one-handed, robust, offline* — with the **Hevy** feel: log a set in ~2 taps, see last time
inline, auto rest timer, celebratory finish, browsable history/PRs/charts. Build it as **new UI +
services on top of the existing, frozen SQLite tables + `src/engine`** — reuse the engine/repos via
services; never rewrite them.

**Non-goals (this track).** AI coaching (chat/`localCoach` stays but is not the focus), nutrition/
calorie tracking, and the B2B2C cloud work (done, valid, untouched). Social features, cardio/duration
exercise types, imperial units, and paywalls are **out of scope by constraint** (see §6).

**Hard rules (non-negotiable, every phase).**
- **Offline-first:** the app fully works with **no network/account** after every phase (trivially
  satisfied — the tracker writes only to local SQLite; there is no network path in it).
- **Frozen files — add NEW modules only, never edit:** `src/engine/*`, `src/components/ui/*`,
  `src/components/charts/*`, or any existing repo/service **signature** in `docs/CONTRACTS.md`.
- TypeScript strict; **kg** weights; `dateISO='YYYY-MM-DD'`; `@/* → apps/mobile/src/*`.
- **Cloud builds only** (GitHub Actions on tag `v*`); verify locally via `npm run typecheck` (in
  `apps/mobile`) + an offline check + adversarial logic/compile review **before any tag**. Owner tags.

---

## 2. Current-state assessment (what exists vs the gap)

### 2.1 What exists today
- **5 route files, 4 tabs.** `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` registers **Home** (`index.tsx`), **Coach**
  (`coach.tsx`), **Progress** (`analytics.tsx`), **Settings** (`settings.tsx`); plus one stack route
  `app/exercise/[id].tsx`. **Workouts are logged ONLY through the AI chat** (`coach.tsx` →
  `orchestrator.sendToCoach` → `COACH_TOOLS.log_workout`). There is **no** manual active-workout
  screen, routine editor, history list, exercise-library list, rest timer, or plate calculator.
- **The data layer is complete and frozen.** SQLite (`src/db/schema.ts`) already has every table the
  tracker needs: `workout_sessions` (with `source` supporting `'manual'`), `set_entries`
  (`isWarmup`), `exercises`, `personal_records`, `workout_plans`/`plan_days`/`plan_exercises`,
  `body_weight`, `meta(key,value)`. Repos (`src/db/repos/*`) and services (`src/services/*`) are
  CONTRACTS-frozen.
- **The engine already does progressive overload** — `engine/computeOverloadTarget`, `epleyE1rm`,
  `computeRecovery`, `computeStrengthScore`, and `services/coach.getTodaysWorkout` (plan rotation +
  targets). This is ForgeAI's edge over pure loggers.
- **The premium UI kit + SVG charts are built and frozen** (`Screen`, `Card`, `GlassCard`, `HeroCard`,
  `StatTile`, `RingGauge`, `Chip`, `PrimaryButton`, `GhostButton`, `IconButton`, `Icon`,
  `AnimatedNumber`, `Skeleton`, `EmptyState`, `Badge`, `TabBar`; charts `LineChart`, `BarChart`,
  `Sparkline`, `MiniBars`, `HBarList`, `Heatmap`, `DeltaPill`). Dark, ember-accent, CVD-safe chart
  palette. `Icon` already includes `dumbbell`, `plus`, `check`, `close`, `clock`, `calendar`,
  `trophy`, `target`, `trend`, `scale`, `chevron-*`.
- **Exercise detail is ~free.** `app/exercise/[id].tsx` already renders hero stats + progress/e1RM/
  volume charts + session history via `services/analytics.getExerciseStats`. The library just needs a
  list screen that navigates to `/exercise/[id]`.
- **PR detection is already wired.** `workoutRepo.addSets` **auto-numbers sets AND calls
  `prRepo.checkAndRecordPrs`** (idempotent per session; records `weight` + `e1rm` PRs). So the
  logging path gets PRs for free.
- **Available deps** (no new install for the core): `react-native-gesture-handler` (swipe-to-delete),
  `react-native-reanimated`, `expo-haptics` (`tap`/`thud`/`success` in `src/lib/haptics.ts`),
  `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `zustand`, `react-native-svg`. **Store pattern**:
  zustand `create` + a `refresh()` that reads a service (see `store/dashboardStore.ts`).

### 2.2 The gap (what the tracker must add)
| Missing surface | Why it's missing | How it's built |
|---|---|---|
| **Active-workout screen** (set grid, ✓, PREVIOUS, rest timer) | logging is chat-only | NEW module; in-memory draft → `createSession`+`addSets` on Finish |
| **Routine authoring** (create/edit/reorder routines) | `planRepo` is **read-only** (`getActivePlan` only) | NEW `routineRepo` writing existing plan tables (no schema change for core) |
| **History list + calendar** | no history screen | NEW screens over `getRecentSessionDetails`/`getSessionsBetween` + `Heatmap` |
| **Exercise library list + custom-exercise form** | only `exercise/[id]` detail exists | NEW screens over `getAllExercises`/`createExercise` |
| **Rest timer, plate calc, warm-up calc** | none exist | NEW pure/ephemeral modules; defaults in `meta` |
| **Weekly streak** | `getStreakDays` is **day-based** | NEW service (don't edit the frozen one) |
| RPE, supersets, drop/failure types, folders, edit-saved-workout, body measurements | no schema columns / repo API | **DEFERRED** — additive schema + new write path (Phase 5) |

---

## 3. Architecture & conventions for the new code

**New-module namespace.** All tracker code lives in **new files the tracker owns**, so no frozen file
is touched:
- `src/tracker/` — the tracker's own namespace: `tracker/db/` (writable `routineRepo`, and later an
  additive `trackerSchema` for Phase-5 tables), `tracker/services/` (finish summary, history, weekly
  streak, exercise analytics, plate/warm-up utils), `tracker/store/` (active-workout draft, rest
  timer, routine store), `tracker/components/` (set row, exercise card, timer bar, muscle-map SVG,
  pickers).
- `src/app/workout/…`, `src/app/routines/…`, `src/app/history/…`, `src/app/library/…` — new
  **route** files (expo-router; `typedRoutes: true` regenerates types on add).

**Reuse, never rewrite.** Consume the frozen repos/services/engine/UI-kit exactly as `docs/CONTRACTS.md`
declares. The only frozen thing the tracker calls to *write* is `workoutRepo.createSession` + `addSets`
+ `deleteSession` (all existing, `source:'manual'` supported).

**Preferences without schema churn.** Rest-timer defaults, warm-up formula, weekly goal, exercise
favorites, and the crash-recovery **active-workout draft** all serialize into the existing frozen
`meta(key,value)` table via `getMeta`/`setMeta` — **no schema change**.

**Additive-schema pattern (Phase 5 only).** Any new column/table is **purely additive** (new nullable
column or new table) and executed by a NEW `src/tracker/db/trackerSchema.ts → initTrackerSchema()`
(idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`) called once from
`app/_layout.tsx` **after `initDb()`** — mirroring how the B2B2C phase added a gated cloud-init call
there. **`schema.ts` and frozen repo signatures are never edited**; every additive column always ships
with a **new write path** (a new repo/service fn), because `createSession`/`addSets` signatures can't
change.

**Allowed minimal screen edits (not frozen — screen files, not CONTRACTS signatures).** To wire the
tracker in we will make small additive edits to:
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — register the new tab(s) (see §4).
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Home) — repoint the "Today: <day>" hero CTA to **Start Workout** (keep a
  secondary "Ask coach" affordance). Additive prop, no dashboard-store change.
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` — add a "Workout" settings group (default rest, keep-awake, warm-up
  formula) mounting a new tracker settings card.
- `app/_layout.tsx` — (Phase 5 only) one `initTrackerSchema()` call + (Phase 1) rehydrate the
  active-workout draft.
These files are owned by their modules in CONTRACTS but are **screens, not frozen APIs**; edits stay
minimal and additive. If the owner prefers zero edits to `index.tsx`, the Start-Workout entry can live
entirely on the new Workout tab instead.

**Offline firewall.** The tracker has **no network code**. Every feature reads/writes local SQLite or
`meta`. The `expo-notifications` rest-timer alert (Phase 2) is a local notification (no server). This
preserves the "zero network with no account" guarantee automatically.

---

## 4. Navigation decision — ✅ CONFIRMED (Option A)

Hevy's bottom nav centers a prominent **Start Workout** and a **History** view. ForgeAI's frozen
`components/ui/TabBar.tsx` renders whatever routes are registered, **but its `ROUTE_ICON` map is
hardcoded** to `index/coach/analytics/settings` and falls back to a generic `sparkle` icon for unknown
routes — and `TabBar.tsx` is a **frozen** file we cannot edit to add a `dumbbell`/`calendar` icon.

**Recommended (Option A):** add a thin **NEW** tracker tab bar (`src/tracker/components/TrackerTabBar.tsx`)
that reuses the exact same tokens/animation/visuals as the frozen `TabBar` but with an extended icon
map, and swap it into `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (editable). This is **additive** (new file; the frozen
`TabBar` is untouched), stays visually identical, and gives proper icons. Proposed tabs:

> **Home · Workout · History · Progress · Profile**  — with **Coach demoted** to a button on Home
> (its `coach.tsx` route is kept and still reachable). This matches the pivot ("chat stays but isn't
> the focus") and the Hevy shape.

**Alternatives:** (B) keep the 4 frozen tabs and launch tracker screens as **stack routes** from a
prominent Home "Start Workout" CTA (zero tab-bar change, but no dedicated Workout/History tab); (C)
add new tabs and accept the generic `sparkle` icon (ugly — not recommended).

## 5. v1 essential feature set (ranked, all buildable with no schema change)

Ranked by leverage (retention × "Hevy feel" × buildability on frozen repos). Items **1–7 are the
core**; 8–15 are the polish that makes it credible.

1. **Active-workout screen** — vertical exercise cards, each a set table `SET# | PREVIOUS | KG | REPS | ✓`.
2. **One-tap set completion** — type kg/reps → ✓ → row greens, haptic (finger-down), rest timer starts.
3. **PREVIOUS column + auto-fill** — ghost placeholder from last session; bare ✓ logs last time.
4. **Rest timer** — auto-start on ✓, ±15s / skip, per-exercise default, local notification at zero.
5. **Two entry paths** — **Start Empty Workout** + **Start From Plan** (`getActivePlan`, read-only).
6. **Exercise library list + picker** — search + 2-axis filter + Recent; entered from tab & mid-workout.
7. **Finish → two-stage** — pre-save edit (note, dayType, time) → celebratory summary (duration,
   volume, counts, new PRs, muscle map).
8. **Warm-up sets** — `isWarmup` toggle via the SET-number cell.
9. **History list + calendar/heatmap** — reverse-chron feed + `Heatmap`; tap a day → session detail.
10. **Per-exercise detail** — enhance `exercise/[id]`: metric switcher, PR rows, tap-record→session.
11. **Plate calculator (kg)** — per-side stack + "closest possible weight" fallback.
12. **Custom exercise create** — `createExercise` (unlimited).
13. **Warm-up calculator** — 40/60/80% default (editable), inserts `isWarmup` rows.
14. **Draft autosave / crash recovery** — draft JSON in `meta['activeWorkoutDraft']`.
15. **Keep-screen-awake + swipe-to-delete-set + undo**.

## 6. Explicitly skipped / deferred

**Skip (violates a hard constraint):** social feed / following / leaderboards / sharing-to-feed ·
iOS Live Activity / Dynamic Island · lb/imperial toggle · Health/Strava sync · free-tier caps &
paywalls · cross-user routine sharing · cardio/duration/distance exercise types · Strength-Level
cohort benchmarking · server-hosted animations/video.

**Defer to Phase 5 (purely additive — new nullable column/table + new write path):** per-set **RPE** ·
**drop/failure** set types · per-set & persistent per-exercise **notes** · **routine folders** ·
**edit-a-saved-workout** · **supersets/circuits** · **body measurements/photos** · "most reps"/"best
duration" PR kinds · per-set target weight in plans · **writable routine editor** (core needs no schema
— see §8 for whether to pull it earlier).

---

## 7. Gap table — how each Hevy capability maps to ForgeAI

**Buildable on EXISTING tables via NEW services (no schema change):**

| Capability | Frozen reuse |
|---|---|
| Active-workout logging | `createSession` + `addSets` (auto set# + PR detect); draft in memory |
| PREVIOUS column + auto-fill | `getExerciseHistory`, `getLastSessionOfDayType` |
| Warm-up sets | `set_entries.isWarmup`; `addSets` accepts it; working-set queries already exclude it |
| Rest timer / warm-up / plate calc | ephemeral UI + pure utils; defaults in `meta` |
| Library browse/search/filter/recent | `getAllExercises` (`name`+`aliases`, `muscleGroup`/`equipment`) |
| Custom exercise | `exerciseRepo.createExercise` (all fields exist) |
| Per-exercise History / Records / e1RM chart | `getExerciseHistory`, `getAllPrs`/`getPrHistory`, `epleyE1rm`, `getExerciseStats` |
| PR kinds weight / e1rm / volume | `personal_records.kind` covers exactly these three |
| Tap-record → session | `personal_records.sessionId` → `getSessionDetail` |
| History feed + calendar/heatmap | `getRecentSessionDetails`, `getSessionsBetween` + `Heatmap` |
| Delete workout / repeat workout | `deleteSession`; `getSessionDetail`→`createSession`+`addSets` |
| Two-stage finish summary + muscle numbers | `getSessionDetail`, `getMuscleGroupVolume`, `getPrHistory` |
| Aggregate analytics | `getWeeklyVolume`, `getWorkoutFrequency`, `getConsistency`, `getAnalyticsBundle` |
| Weekly streak (fix day→week) | new service over `getSessionsBetween`; goal in `meta` |
| Favorites / rest map / warm-up formula / draft | JSON in `meta(key,value)` |
| Start-from-plan | `planRepo.getActivePlan` (read-only) |

**Needs additive schema (Phase 5, additive only):** per-set RPE (`set_entries.rpe`) · set types
(`set_entries.setType`) · supersets (`set_entries.supersetGroup`) · per-set notes (`set_entries.note`) ·
routine folders (`routine_folders` + `workout_plans.folderId`) · body measurements
(`body_measurements`) · session title/media. **Writable routines** = a new `routineRepo` over existing
tables (**core: no schema**; `plan_exercises.restSec/.notes/.targetWeightKg` are additive niceties).
**Edit-saved-workout** = new SQL in a new module (tables already support it; only the repo API is missing).

---

## 8. Owner decisions — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-08)

1. **Tab structure / navigation** → **Option A (CONFIRMED).** A NEW `TrackerTabBar` (copies the frozen
   `TabBar` look/tokens, extended icon map) → tabs **Home · Workout · History · Progress · Profile**;
   **Coach demoted** to a Home button (route kept). Frozen `TabBar.tsx` untouched.
2. **Routine authoring placement** → **Phase 5a (CONFIRMED).** Ship the logger first (P1–P4); the
   writable routine editor lands in Phase 5a. v1 routine substitute = seeded active plan +
   Start-From-Plan + repeat-workout.
3. **Rest-timer background alert** → **YES (default).** Add `expo-notifications` + `expo-keep-awake` in
   Phase 2 (offline local notification at zero + keep-awake). Owner-gated dep add flagged at P2.
4. **Home hero CTA** → **Repoint with fallback (default).** Home's "Today: <day>" card starts a workout
   (from the plan day) with a secondary "Ask coach" affordance.

---

## 9. Phased build plan

Each phase is small, shippable, offline-safe, and ends with the verification ritual (§10) + a
PROGRESS.md note + STOP-and-report. No frozen file is edited in any phase.

### Phase 1 — Log a workout (the spine)  ⭐ makes it "feel like Hevy"
- **Goal:** a real manual active-workout flow — Start Empty / Start From Plan → set grid with PREVIOUS
  + one-tap ✓ + warm-up toggle → Finish → summary. **No schema change.**
- **Add:** `src/tracker/store/activeWorkoutStore.ts` (in-memory draft `{exercises:[{exerciseId,
  rows:[{weightKg,reps,isWarmup}]}], startedAt, dayType}` + autosave to `meta['activeWorkoutDraft']`);
  `src/tracker/components/` (`ExerciseLogCard`, `SetRow` with ✓/keypad/haptic-on-down, `ExercisePicker`);
  `src/tracker/services/finishSummary.ts`; routes `app/workout/active.tsx`, `app/workout/index.tsx`
  (start screen: Empty vs From Plan), `app/workout/finish.tsx`.
- **Reuse (frozen):** `createSession({source:'manual'})`, `addSets` (auto set# + PRs), `getActivePlan`,
  `getExerciseHistory`/`getLastSessionOfDayType` (PREVIOUS), `getAllExercises`, UI kit + `dashboardStore.refresh`.
- **Edit (minimal, screens):** `_layout.tsx` (tab per §4 decision), `app/_layout.tsx` (rehydrate draft),
  optionally `index.tsx` hero CTA.
- **Success:** start an empty or from-plan workout, log sets with PREVIOUS prefill + warm-up, Finish
  commits a `source:'manual'` session, PRs appear, Home/Progress reflect it; kill the app mid-workout
  and the draft restores; **zero network**; `typecheck` green.
- **Risks:** draft/serialization correctness; set-number/PR parity via `addSets`; keypad + haptic feel.

### Phase 2 — Rest timer + barbell math
- **Goal:** the rest timer + plate/warm-up calculators + safe set deletion.
- **Add:** `src/tracker/store/restTimerStore.ts` (countdown, ±15s, skip; default in `meta`;
  local notification at zero); `src/tracker/services/plateCalculator.ts` + `warmupCalculator.ts` (pure);
  `RestTimerBar`, `PlateCalcSheet`, swipe-to-delete on `SetRow` + undo snackbar; Settings "Workout"
  group (default rest, keep-awake, warm-up formula).
- **Reuse:** `AnimatedNumber`, `GhostButton`, `Icon('clock')`, `exercises.equipment/incrementKg`,
  `gesture-handler`.
- **Deps (owner-gated, §8.3):** `expo-notifications`, `expo-keep-awake`.
- **Success:** ✓ auto-starts the timer; ±15s/skip work; notification fires at zero offline; plate calc
  shows per-side stack + "closest possible weight"; warm-up calc inserts `isWarmup` rows; swipe-delete
  + undo; keep-awake scoped to the workout; `typecheck` green.

### Phase 3 — History + calendar + finish polish
- **Goal:** browse the past — feed, calendar/heatmap, session detail, weekly streak, repeat-workout.
- **Add:** `src/tracker/services/history.ts`, `weeklyStreak.ts`; routes `app/history/index.tsx`
  (feed + `Heatmap` calendar), `app/history/[sessionId].tsx` (session detail + delete + repeat);
  `MuscleMap` SVG component; finish-summary polish (streak, muscle map, playful comparison).
- **Reuse:** `getRecentSessionDetails`, `getSessionsBetween`, `getSessionDetail`, `deleteSession`,
  `getMuscleGroupVolume`, `getPrHistory`, `Heatmap`, `HeroCard`/`StatTile`.
- **Success:** calendar paints workout days; tap → detail; delete a past workout; "repeat" clones it
  into today via `createSession`+`addSets`; weekly streak matches Hevy semantics; `typecheck` green.

### Phase 4 — Library + exercise detail + analytics + export
- **Goal:** the exercise spine — library list, custom exercise, richer per-exercise detail, bodyweight,
  export.
- **Add:** `app/library/index.tsx` (search + 2-axis `Chip` filter + Recent), `app/library/new.tsx`
  (custom exercise form → `createExercise`); `src/tracker/services/exerciseAnalytics.ts` (metric series
  + xRM ladder computed on read), `dataExport.ts` (CSV/JSON to a local file); enhance `exercise/[id]`
  (metric switcher, PR rows, tap→session); bodyweight quick-log + `LineChart`; timeframe `Chip`s.
- **Reuse:** `getAllExercises`/`findExerciseByName`/`createExercise`, `getExerciseStats`, `getAllPrs`,
  `epleyE1rm`, `LineChart`/`Sparkline`/`Chip`, `logBodyWeight`/`getBodyWeightHistory`.
- **Success:** browse/search/filter the library; open detail; create a custom exercise and use it;
  metric switcher + PR rows work; export a local CSV/JSON offline; bodyweight logs + charts;
  `typecheck` green.

### Phase 5 — Additive depth (only after 1–4 are solid; each independent + schema-additive)
Pick per demo value; each ships behind existing UI without touching frozen files, via a new
`initTrackerSchema()` + new write paths:
- **5a Writable routine editor** — `src/tracker/db/routineRepo.ts` (create/update/delete/duplicate/
  reorder/setActive over existing plan tables; **core needs no schema**) + `plan_exercises.restSec/.notes`
  + "update routine after workout?" write-back. *(May move earlier — §8.2.)*
- **5b Set types + RPE** — `set_entries.setType` + `.rpe` (+ new write path around `addSets`).
- **5c Edit-a-saved-workout** — new module (tables support it; only repo API missing).
- **5d Body measurements** — `body_measurements` table + screen.
- **5e Supersets + folders** — `set_entries.supersetGroup`, `routine_folders`/`workout_plans.folderId`
  (lowest priority).

---

## 10. Verification ritual (every phase)
`npm run typecheck` green (in `apps/mobile`) · **offline demo makes zero network calls and fully
works** (log a workout, browse history/analytics, `localCoach` still there) · **no frozen file touched**
(engine / components/ui / components/charts / existing repo+service signatures) · phase success
criteria met · adversarial **logic + compile review before any tag** · `PROGRESS.md` updated · small
committed steps · **STOP + report + wait for "continue."** Owner tags releases (cloud build only).
