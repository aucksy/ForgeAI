# ForgeAI progress

## Done
- 2026-07-04: Scaffolded (Expo SDK 56, deps incl. expo-speech-recognition),
  contract layer, docs. `tsc` green.
- 2026-07-05: Wave 1 (DB repos, overload/recovery/strength engine + services,
  premium UI kit + SVG charts, AI layer w/ Anthropic+OpenAI REST + offline
  localCoach, 3-month demo seed, brand icons). Wave 2 (dashboard, coach chat
  w/ rich cards + voice + photo, analytics, exercise + settings screens).
  Both waves `tsc` green and committed/pushed (github.com/aucksy/ForgeAI).
- 2026-07-05: `expo prebuild` android/ committed with CI-driven signing
  (release keystore from Actions secrets, debug-signing fallback when absent).
- 2026-07-05: Adversarial review (5 finders -> per-finding skeptics -> fixes).
  19 confirmed findings fixed (2 HIGH, 6 MED, 11 LOW); 5 refuted. `tsc` green,
  committed (c24e35c). See the commit body for the full list.

## Next
- Tag `v0.1.0` -> GitHub Actions builds signed(or debug-signed) APK+AAB ->
  paste the direct .apk link. First test build needs NO secrets.
- For a properly release-signed build: run the "Generate release keystore"
  workflow once, set the 4 ANDROID_* Actions secrets (owner-gated).

## Deliberately deferred (not bugs â€” scoped for the demo)
- **Pounds (lb) units**: shipped kg-only. Full lb needs input parsing + every
  localCoach reply string (both languages) + cards + analytics + profile sync;
  half-doing it is worse than kg-only. Settings shows "lb coming soon".
- A/B plan-day tie-break when a chat log contains only exercises shared by both
  variants (LOW, self-corrects on the next full log; rotation fix mitigates).
- Strength-benchmark name-matching could over-match accessories IF a main lift
  is missing (unreachable with the seed; hardening item if real onboarding lands).

## Gotchas / lessons
- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` isn't hoisted â€” TabBar uses a structural type.
- Keep `chart.series` order (CVD-validated). Dark-only UI.
- Demo must impress with NO API key: provider defaults to `local`, seeded data.
- Seed is DELETE-first + idempotent; reset uses forceReseed() (bypasses memo).
- Commit messages with inner double-quotes: use `git commit -F <file>`, not a
  PowerShell here-string (the quotes word-split the -m arg).
- Node not on default PATH: prepend `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nodejs`.
